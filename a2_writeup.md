# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them. 

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

While completing the match function something that was difficult for me was 
following all the steps and what the process requires. For example the % can 
highlight/match many words or code. I was also trying not to make as many 
mistakes. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

I could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database 
by finding a specific pattern or a specific format that makes it easier to find or
search movies. For example if you have a list of movie titles and you want to find titles that begin with
"The" then you can use the pattern "The", "_" or something similar to find matching titles.
